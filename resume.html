            Primary maintainer and team lead for about 5 years. Currently, has approximately 200 members.
            Stepping stone to leaving technologies including Python, Bash, PHP, JSON, HTML, CSS, JS,
            Ansible, Linux, and SQL as demanded by the project's requirements. Self&hyphen;taught
            database design and normalization. Used networking concepts such as the OSI model, tunneling
            protocols (VXLAN, OpenVPN, EoIP), and BGP for practical purposes. My ASN is 202313.

            Learned and deployed a ticketing system (OsTicket). Developed soft stills dealing with
            members who are novices at computer networking and often have a language barrier. Adapted
            to rapidly changing requirements as members made requests for unanticipated configurations.

        <p>
            I work closely with my boss and owner Jonathan Blow on the compiler and built&hyphen;in libraries
            for Thekla's new programming language Jai. I wrote a library for asynchronous file IO and rewrote
            the Unicode library. I contribute to various other libraries including those for atomics and
            synchronization. In the compiler, I fix bugs and make general improvements where I find that
            they can be made. I also work on improvements for C and Objective&hyphen;C interoperability.
            The company uses Jai for a future video game. I make some improvements to use features of the
            libraries that I have built or improved. I also play&hyphen;test the game and review the code
            as a way of finding interesting improvements that can be made to the language and the libraries.

            TA of two courses, CPSC 203 and 259. Both designed for students outside computer science. In 203,
            I worked directly with Dr. Cinda Heeren and participated in the creation of course materials.
            We introduced programming in Python and the basics of building data-structures and algorithms to
            students from all over the university. In 259, I taught electrical engineers data-structures and
            algorithms focusing on usage of pointers and the difference between the stack, heap, and static data.
