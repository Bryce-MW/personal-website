        </h3>
        <p>
            I am the most proud of the EVIX project because it has about 200 active members and I have kept maintaining
            it for about 3 years. Through EVIX, I designed my first database when our original one became too difficult
            to use, learned Ansible when we needed proper deployment, and designed the website from scratch when the
            template we used before had unfixable issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the number of members grew in size, I started using a ticketing system (OsTicket). With so many members,
            I have had many asking for configurations that I did not originally imagine. Dealing with unexpected changes
            to requirements is a valuable on-the-job skill that is rarely experienced in personal projects.

        <p>
            I went above the class requirements by implementing a significantly more complex application than was needed
            to demonstrate the required skills. I enjoy programming so I ended up writing about 4000 lines. I had past
            experience in Java but I've never written an application this large. The project centred around a visual
            exploration of structured data.

        <p>
            Last year, I was a TA for CPSC 203, a class for non&hyphen;CS majors. I worked directly with Dr. Cinda
            Heeren and participated in the creation of course materials. This year, I am a TA for CPSC 259 which covers
            data structures and algorithms for electrical engineers in C.

        <p>
            I worked under the direction of Dr. Denise Daley and her research team. My primary role was to develop data
            processing systems as needed for ongoing genetic research projects. In my role, I worked on updating a large
            project in Java to work with new research data and wrote data processing shell scripts to be run on a
            computing cluster.
