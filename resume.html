        <p>
            The EVIX project has been an incredible learning experience. I have learned both soft skills like working on
            a team, answering support tickets, and dealing with complaints, as well as many technical skills. The
            project has required many languages including Python, JQ, PHP, Bash, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Many of
            those I used for the first time on the project. I also designed a database schema and learned dev-ops tools
            like Ansible. We currently have almost 200 members so I have had to accommodate for widely varying
            configurations and use-cases.

        </h3>
        <p>
            This project was a part of one of the software development courses that I took. I went above the
            requirements significantly with my overall lines of code being over 4000 which is about 10 times the
            requirements. While I had significant experience with Java, this was my first time using Swing so I was very
            excited to create a GUI. The project centred around a visual exploration of structured data which is often
            used by AIs like Siri and Wolfram Alpha to answer questions.
