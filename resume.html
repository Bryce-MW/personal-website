            Primary maintainer and team lead for about 3 years. Currently, has approximately 200 members. Learned many
            technologies including Python, Bash, PHP, JSON, HTML, CSS, JS, Ansible, Linux, and SQL. Self-taught database
            design and normalization. Used networking concepts such as the OSI model, tunneling protocols (VXLAN,
            OpenVPN, EoIP), and BGP. My ASN is 202313.

            With about 200 members, we needed a ticketing system (OsTicket). Many members ask for configurations not
            originally imagined. Dealing with unexpected changes to requirements is a valuable skill that is rarely
            experienced in personal projects.

            I enjoy programming so a wrote a 4000 line program for this school project, going far beyond the
            requirements. I had a significant amount of experience though I had never written a project of this size
            before, so I wanted to challenge myself. This project centred around a visual exploration of structured
            data. See the project page for a demo video.

            TA of two courses, CPSC 203 and 259. Both courses are for non-computer science majors. In 203, I worked
            directly with Dr. Cinda Heeren and participated in the creation of course materials. In 259, I taught
            data-structures and algorithms especially usage of pointers and the difference between the stack, heap, and
            static data.

            I worked under the direction of Dr. Denise Daley and her research team. My primary role was to develop data
            processing systems as needed for ongoing genetic research projects. In my role, I worked on updating a large
            project in Java to work with new research data and wrote data processing shell scripts to be run on a
            computing cluster.
